Bloggy can be hosted on a CDN for free (Cloudflare Pages), providing a fast and reliable experience for our readers. With this setup, we no longer have to worry about scalability, expenses, or downtime, as the blog is served directly from the CDN. This allows us to focus on creating great content, while knowing that our readers will have a seamless experience. We hope you enjoy the bloggy and thank you for your support!
